# themeparty
Collection of themes for the oekaki board "Poti-board" by satopian. I figured it'd be wasteful if I kept these to myself, so I decided to share them. More may be added over time.
# Notice
I'm new to github and still learning everything. Please be patient with me.
# Installation
Copy "themeparty" folder found in the language folder of your choice (English, Japanese) to the same folder as poti-board. Change the theme directory in config.php to 'themeparty/'
# Credit
Please keep the credits in the footer. Feel free to modify, redistribute as long as the credits are intact. If modifying you can change it to "modified from", "based on", "&" etc, as long as the link remains in the footer it's all good.
